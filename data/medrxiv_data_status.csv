No personal data will be shared and the data is fully anonymised. The data management plan stipulates access: 5.1. Suitability for sharing The anonymised data are suitable for sharing with collaborators. 5.2. Discovery by potential users of the research data Potential users are pointed to the data through publications and the study website and can apply for data sharing via a collaboration. They will be able to get access to the data directly through data repositories such as the one recently launched at KCL with searchable metadata (www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/research-data-management/ DepositPublishPromote/Deposit-your-data-with-Kings.aspx) after an embargo period of 5 years.  5.3. Governance of access Primary decisions will be made by the PI, and subsequently reviewed by an independent advisor. 5.4. The study teams exclusive use of the data  There will be an embargo of 5 years after study completion during which only the original research team and new researchers in the PIs lab or invited collaborators will have access. 5.5. Restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions  See above 5.6. Regulation of responsibilities of users  People outside the research team who want to collaborate and use data will have to agree to a data sharing agreement in line with MRC principles.

The data of infected case during the corresponding period mainly come from the daily epidemic data released by the National Health Commission. The self-control and traffic control data come from the public information of each city's Health Commission website and government website on taking preventive and control measures, and they are scored uniformly according to the degree of control, and the corresponding values are added up. The national migration data and Wuhan's outflow data come from Baidu Migration. The control variables at the city level come from China City Statistical Yearbook. In addition, cities without outbreaks were also excluded. After collation, 6417 observations from 301 cities were finally obtained.

The LISS-panel started in 2007 and is based on a large traditional probability sample drawn from the Dutch population. The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research funded the set-up of LISS. Panel members receive an incentive of 15 per hour for their participation and those who do not have a computer and/or Internet access are provided with the necessary equipment at home. Further information about all conducted surveys and regulations for free access to the data can be found at www.lissdata.nl (in English). The LISS panel has received the international Data Seal of Approval (see https://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/). Data on corona-related questions will be added to the open access data archive soon.

NPFH was the designated hospital for admission of COVID-19 infection patients in Nanping city, and set up the expert group for medical treatment of COVID-19 (Conv-MG). Suspicious patients found by other medical units in Nanping city after preliminary screening should be transferred to NPFH for treatment. All patients with NCIP enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. From January 29th to February 14th, the ConV-TG of NPFH used electronic stethoscopes to auscultate the lungs of newly admitted patients with COVID-19 infection. On March 5, after all the patients were discharged from the hospital, the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the above patients were retrospectively analyzed, which included the pulmonary signs.

Data regarding cases that have undergone testing were obtained from Our World in Data[25]. Age distribution of confirmed cases, those admitted to ICU, and deceased patients in Spain was based on data available from the Spanish Ministry of Health[26]. The concentration of 25(OH)D among the elderly population in each country was obtained from prior studies[2732]. CRP data, Vit D, data and demographic variables of the subjects were pooled the cross-sectional data from 2009-2010 NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [22]. Data regarding the risk factors including blood pressure[33], body to mass ratio[34], and diabetes[35], were obtained from published articles. Data on coronary heart disease (CHD) death rates across different countries was used based on the calculation of World Life Expectancy on data reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [36]. The link between high CRP and severe COVID-19 was examined based on data from a study investigating the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in China[23].

Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up.

If the reader is not a member of the consortium, their concept form must be sponsored by a principal investigator (PI) of one of the PRACTICAL consortium member studies. If approved by the Data Access Committee, PIs within the consortium, each of whom retains ownership of their data submitted to the consortium, can then choose to participate in the specific proposal.  In addition, portions of the data are available for request from dbGaP (database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) which is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/?term=Icogs+prostatehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/?term=Icogs+prostate.  Anyone can apply to join the consortium. The eligibility requirements are listed here: http://practical.icr.ac.uk/blog/?page_id=9. Joining the consortium would not guarantee access, as a proposal for access would still be submitted to the Data Access Committee, but there would be no need for a separate member sponsor.

For estimates of the time-varying effective reproduction number (Figure 2), the complete line listed data within the Australian national COVID-19 database are not publicly available. However, we provide the cases per day by notification date and state (as shown in Figures 1 and S1) which, when supplemented with the estimated distribution of the delay from symptom onset to notification (samples from this distribution are provided as a data file), analyses of the time-varying effective reproduction number can be performed.

One such site is The Humanitarian Data Exchange and one can find daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 per country. https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases has a downloadable  time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv starting from 2020-01-22, and for some countries, it even has the data broken down into different states or provinces. In order to perform the desired analysis, daily cases for each country had to be obtained, but some countries, such as the US and Australia, had the data broken down to state or provincial level. Since the focus of this research was per country, R open source software was used to sum along the unique values of Country, appropriately transforming the data for our analysis, then and non-linear regression was performed using the nls function.https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

We used both published summary results (i.e. taking results from published research papers and websites) and individual participant cohort data as follows:  Journal published and website summary data were used for sample one of the two sample Mendelian randomization (published GWAS of BMI and body fat percentage). The references to those published data sources are provided in the main paper. The data for the GWAS of BMI is available here. https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files  The data for the GWAS of body fat percentage is available here. https://walker05.u.hpc.mssm.edu   We used individual participant data for the second MR sample and for undertaking sensitivity analyse from the UKB, ALSPAC, BiB, EFSOCH and HAPO cohorts.   The data in UKB, ALSPAC and BiB are fully available, via managed systems, to any researchers. The managed system for both studies is a requirement of the study funders but access is not restricted on the basis of overlap with other applications to use the data or on the basis of peer review of the proposed science. Researchers have to pay for a dataset to be prepared for them.  UKB. Full information on how to access these data can be found here - https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/using-the-resource/  ALSPAC. The ALSPAC data management plan (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/documents/alspac-data-management-plan.pdf) describes in detail the policy regarding data sharing, which is through a system of managed open access.

Osteosarcoma is a rare disease in adults, and is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and young adolescents. Most patients present localized disease and cure rates are around 60% in the pediatric population with contemporary treatments regimens These results were established by several landmark studies during 1970s and 1980s.  They demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy and later neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Considering this, standard chemotherapy for adult patients frequently does not include high-dose methotrexate. A comprehension of the outcomes of these patients without methotrexate is important to understand the disease scenario of this selected population and to guide the development of new treatment strategies with acceptable tolerance. The present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of adult patients with high-grade localized osteosarcoma treated with chemotherapy regimens without methotrexate. Due to the clinical importance of the subject, we believe that our work would be of interest for ESMO  Open readers.  With the submission of this letter I would like to undertake that the above-mentioned manuscript has not been published, accepted for publication and neither is under editorial review for publication elsewhere.     All authors contributed to conception, drafting the article and final approval of the version being submitted.   Sincerely, The authors.

A multinational steering committee [Supplement 1] oversees registry operations worldwide and approves investigator-initiated or site-specific sub-studies, external requests for data, and reviews suggestions by participants. To date, several sub-studies have been initiated focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on the brain, heart, kidneys, management and risks of ECMO, coagulation and thrombosis risks and long-term effects, all involving multi-center participation. Once approval is obtained, relevant de-identified data will be made available. It is anticipated that, following study completion, all de-identified data will be made open access.

However, the data are available, on request, from Prof. Anne-Catherine Bachoud-Levi, for research purposes only. The person requesting the data must sign a confidentiality agreement provided by Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris stipulating that they will make no attempt to identify participants. Given the small size of the cohorts studied, the identification of mutation carriers from center information is feasible. Thus, even with a signed confidentiality agreement, some of the information will be removed, to ensure confidentiality.

Since ERA-Interim is only available up to 2019, we used 6-hourly ERA5T35 data (0.25 by 0.25 degree horizontal resolution) for the recent February-April 2020 period. Daily COVID-19 epidemiological data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering is available at country-scale since 22 January 2020 at https://data.humdata.org/. The most up-to-date COVID data for each US state at a daily temporal resolution is taken from the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/data/). Population data for world countries and US states was downloaded from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population and https://www.wikipedia.org, respectively. Weekly laboratory confirmed influenza cases by country for the period October 15th, 1995 to August 31st, 2019 are retrieved from the World Health Organization's FluNet database, accessible at https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/. The dataset consists in weekly totals of identified influenza A and B cases, along with the number of subjects tested.http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/

This kind of study was an authorized option in Spain, with or without a clinical trial. This is not a clinical trial. It is an observational study with an intervention approved by the Direction of the Hospital. A few weeks ago, our healthcare system was on the verge of collapse, we were running out of hospital beds, and with the strategy of a therapeutic approach easy to carry out in a Hospitality Home-Care Unit, we were able to effectively reduce the hospital burden. We think that these data can be useful to expand knowledge in this therapeutic pattern.

Its corresponding population, GDP, and areas were collected in the statistical yearbook. Also, the daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 for each county of each state in the United States were downloaded and available online since March 1, 2020. The corresponding populations, areas, and latitudes were collected from the United States Census Bureau (USCB). The White House issued a "call to action" for coronavirus guidelines including canceling gathering over 10 people and staying at home on March 16, 2020.

The RKI collects the data from local health authorities and provides updates on a daily basis. Using these data (available via API), we build a balanced panel for 401 NUTS Level 3 regions and 95 days spanning the period from January 28 to May 1, 2020 (38,095 observations). We use the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases in each district as main outcome variable. We estimate overall effects for this variable together with disaggregated effects by age groups (persons aged 15-34 years, 35-59 years and 60+ years). As an alternative outcome variable, we also use the cumulative incidence rate. Table 1 shows summary statistics for both variables for our sample period.https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/
