# medRxiv-data-statements

This repository contains code used to scrape the data statements of all submissions to medRxiv, parse and categorize them based on regular expressions. 

# Usage

The main_data.py script will scrape the metadata of all submissions to medRxiv, will then collect the data statements of each submission individually, and will indentify which submission is related to COVID-19.
